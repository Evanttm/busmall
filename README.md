Project: This is a project for a potential Skymall like company called BusMall. The Marketing Research team requested that an app be built to display potential products to individuals focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side). The individuals then choose which one they would most likely buy. After these decisions are logged then results are shown.
